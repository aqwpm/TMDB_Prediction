The victorious Nesib, Emir of Hobeika, lays down his peace terms to rival Amar, Sultan of Salmaah. The two men agree that neither can lay claim to the area of no man‚Äôs land between them called The Yellow Belt. In return, Nesib adopts Amar‚Äôs two boys Saleeh and Auda as a guarantee against invasion. Twelve years later, Saleeh and Auda have grown into young men. Saleeh, the warrior, itches to escape his gilded cage and return to his father‚Äôs land. Auda cares only for books and the pursuit of knowledge. One day, their adopted father Nesib is visited by an American from Texas. He tells the Emir that his land is blessed with oil and promises him riches beyond his wildest imagination. Nesib imagines a realm of infinite possibility, a kingdom with roads, schools and hospitals all paid for by the black gold beneath the barren sand. There is only one problem. The precious oil is located in the Yellow Belt.",6.475665,/iQd7zWhSeCe3cgdPcLIDXjGfdzL.jpg,1324425600000000000,130.0,Released,,Black Gold,5446000,2011,12,21,2,No Collection,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10,Akin Gazi Antonio Banderas Corey Johnson Eriq Ebouaney Freida Pinto Liya Kebede Lotfi Dziri Mark Strong Riz Ahmed Tahar Rahim,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,36,1,8,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,2,1,12,5,8,4,2,4,2,4,3,0,0,17.50439003707821,2.0116530785304607,307692.3076923077,6176971.785909246,9.89090089045308,310.5472565365873,0.0032201218299353555,114.88546563120752,999.6753523072986,1,0,0,1,10,2,2,175.0,,,,

It was adapted from a novella by Wenders' long-time collaborator Peter Handke. A goalkeeper is sent off during a game for committing a foul. He spends the night with a cinema cashier, whom he afterwards kills. Although a type of detective film, it is more slow moving and contemplative than other films of the genre. It explores the monotony of the murderer's existence and, like many of Wenders' films, the overwhelming cultural influence of America in post-war West Germany.",0.769053,/9KicBiKkg6h8dyKM4BBeD3Jy9nt.jpg,67305600000000000,101.0,Released,,The Goalie's Anxiety at the Penalty Kick,100,1972,2,19,5,No Collection,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11,Arthur Brauss Bert Fortell Bert Fortell Edda K√∂chl Erika Pluhar Kai Fischer Libgart Schwarz Marie Bardischewski Michael Toost Rosl Dorena Wim Wenders,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,6,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,3,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,12.923914877701906,0.5704443751584648,4059.4059405940593,533123.2047726229,0.10543141506445203,2564.192584906372,0.00038998630831643,152.5853441980156,3456.9540622645186,0,0,1,1,36,6,7,97.0,,,,

Ilya is a character close to the ""hooker with a heart of gold"" clich√©. Homer feels Ilya's life style typifies the degradation of Greek classical culture and attempts to steer her onto the path of morality. It constitutes a variation of the Pygmalion story.  The film stars Melina Mercouri and Jules Dassin, and it gently submerges the viewer into Greek culture, including dance, music, and language (through the use of subtitles).

His work as a writer on an outrageous, semi-pornographic TV show is less than satisfying. His fifteen year old son has just told him he is gay and his eleven year old is afraid of, well pretty much everything. When his wife, Jeannie (Helen Hunt), moves her sick and embittered father (Brian Dennehy) from Detroit into their home in NY, it puts added stress on an already strained marriage. And when a sexy female co-worker (Carla Gugino) puts the moves on Ned, the temptation sends him spiraling. EVERY DAY is about one family's struggle to survive the unexpected curve-balls that are simply part of real life; aging and death; commitment and freedom; love and acceptance.

626,15000000,,tt0052618,en,Ben-Hur,"Ben-Hur is a 1959 epic film directed by William Wyler, the third film version of Civil War vet Lew Wallace's 1880 novel Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ. It premiered at Loew's State Theatre in New York City on November 18, 1959. The movie's reputation as a classic is primarily based on two spectacular action sequences:  the great chariot race and a Roman naval battle, along with lavish production values and strong performances.  The plot of Ben Hur revolves around a Jewish prince who is betrayed and sent into slavery by a Roman friend and how he regains his freedom and comes back for revenge. However, instead he finds redemption in Christ, the theme is ultimately about being saved in the Christian sense.  The film went on to win a record of eleven Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor (Charlton Heston as Ben Hur). This record-setting Oscars sweep has since been equaled by Titanic in 1998 and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King in 2004, but never broken.",14.319743,/syPMBvvZsADTTRu3UKuxO1Wflq.jpg,-316137600000000000,212.0,Released,The entertainment experience of a lifetime.,Ben-Hur,146900000,1959,12,26,5,No Collection,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,12,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,57,Ady Berber Aldo Pini Aldo Silvani Andr√© Morell Antonio Corevi Cathy O'Donnell Charlton Heston Cliff Lyons David Davies Dervis Ward Diego Pozzetto Duncan Lamont Eddie Jauregui Edwin Richfield Enzo Fiermonte Ferdy Mayne Finlay Currie Franco Fantasia Frank Thring George Relph Gianni Solaro Giuliano Gemma Haya Harareet Hector Ross Howard Lang Hugh Griffith Jack Hawkins Jerry Brown Joe Canutt Joe Yrigoyen John Horsley John Le Mesurier Jos√© Greci Lando Buzzanca Laurence Payne Liana Del Balzo Marina Berti Martha Scott Maxwell Shaw May McAvoy Michael Dugan Mino Doro Nazzareno Zamperla Pietro Tordi Raimondo Van Riel Ralph Truman Remington Olmsted Richard Coleman Richard Hale Robert Brown Sam Jaffe Stella Rho Stephen Boyd Stevenson Lang Terence Longdon Tiberio Mitri Tutte Lemkow,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,25,3,23,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,1,1,0,8,4,6,12,4,3,4,2,6,2,0,0,16.52356082573315,2.7291423887148167,70754.71698113208,1047504.8330127153,3.908610434270071,136.8041311914606,0.007309720775906075,118.55798036880343,717.8079121487372,1,0,0,1,7,1,1,174.0,6.0,,,

Wanting to please his father and continue the family business, Ponce has recruited his young children as performers while laboring night and day to maintain the circus's faltering financial fortunes. But a growing resentment brewing within his wife about their hardscrabble existence suggests troubles on the horizon. While documenting the brutal regimen of circus life, Circo also peels back the curtain on the Ponce family's inner dynamics, revealing generational divides and money worries that threaten to tear apart a marriage. Buttressed by indie-rock band Calexico's evocative score, Schock's film observes this family drama with a sympathetic but clear-eyed view of a vanishing way of life. And because Circo refuses to be sentimental in its handling of the material, the story's twists become all the more poignant",0.077653,/m7Iu5dMCfakAmjF9bzmIKsPc3Bq.jpg,1301616000000000000,75.0,Released,,Circo,67821,2011,4,1,4,No Collection,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.07478552827500773,0.0,0.0,0.0,25897.260891401493,3.86141223272004e-05,inf,26890.22925137306,1,0,0,1,5,1,1,142.0,,,,

712,0,,tt0087751,en,Mrs. Soffel,"Based on a true story, Mrs. Soffel is set in Pittsburgh near the dawn of the 20th century.  Peter Soffel (Edward Herrmann) is the warden of a top security prison, and his wife Kate (Diane Keaton) often comes by to read the Bible aloud to the inmates, despite her fragile health.  While making her rounds, she makes the acquaintance of the Biddle Brothers, Ed (Mel Gibson) and Jack (Matthew Modine), who are sentenced to death for murder and robbery.  Ed has become something of a celebrity thanks to his letter-writing campaign, in which he appeals in the letter-to-the-editor columns of the popular press to stay the execution of his brother and himself.  His good looks, intelligence, and charm make a strong impression on Kate, whose marriage offers her little excitement.  In time, Kate finds herself falling in love with Ed, and she discovers that she's unexpectedly receptive to his suggestion that she help him escape.",1.893822,/vjTD6WkHqJhsor0AGRhcTPuJunN.jpg,472867200000000000,112.0,Released,A true story,Mrs. Soffel,4385312,1984,12,26,2,No Collection,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,11,Diane Keaton Edward Herrmann Jennifer Dundas Joyce Ebert Matthew Modine Maury Chaykin Mel Gibson Paula Trueman Terry O'Quinn Trini Alvarado William Youmans,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,3,6,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,3,1,1,0,1,0,1,2,1,0,0,0,0.0,1.0625781197523783,0.0,0.0,0.0,1047.6169354881295,0.000954547379032258,inf,1867.156835925013,1,0,0,1,11,2,2,155.0,3.0,,,
