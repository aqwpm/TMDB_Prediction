Setting out in appalling conditions with hopelessly inadequate equipment, they endured all weather and terrain and finally reached safety. Persuading a local team of his confidence that the abandoned team would still be alive, he set out again to find them.

1102,0,,tt0092794,en,Crazy Love,"Three 'Bukowskian' torrid nights in the life of a man in search of love. Harry Voss, 12, is young and naive. Love, for him, is romantic love between princes and princesses demurely kissing each other on the mouth. His father is a hero who kidnapped his mother and married her on a lonely mountain peak... Later on, he'll do the same. But Harry has a lot to learn. He learns about 'being hot' and 'fucking' and about what you have to do when you're alone and 'feel the itch'. He also learns that there are handsome men and ugly ones, that love can be unfair.

The film earned a reputation as being one of the most violent films ever made up to that point and was subsequently refused a certificate in Britain until 1993, when it was eventually issued an 18 certificate. Subsequent to this the film was downgraded to a 15 certificate in 2004. Although the name is referenced in over thirty ""sequels"" from the time of the film's release until the mid 1980s in an effort to capitalize on the success of the original, none of these films were official, featuring neither Corbucci nor Nero. Nero did reprise his role as Django in 1987's Django 2: Il Grande Ritorno (Django Strikes Again), in the only official sequel to be written by Corbucci.",4.891638,/7YCMQ6ybiSv67EJJ1cb2Q1WKX4T.jpg,1966-04-05,93.0,Released,The movie that spawned a genre.,Django,17277,1966,4,5,1,Django - Original films,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9,Eduardo Fajardo Franco Nero Gino Pernice Giovanni Ivan Scratuglia Jos√© B√≥dalo Loredana Nusciak Luciano Rossi Lucio De Santis √Ångel √Ålvarez,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0,5,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,3,2,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,2,1,1,0,3,1,1,1,2,0,0,0,0.0,1.7735340574732694,0.0,0.0,0.0,401.9103621322755,0.002488116988809766,inf,1108.5211426956944,1,0,0,1,6,1,1,139.0,6.0,,,
